                <p>
                  Lukas Carey completed his Doctorate in Education and has worked in the field for most
                  of his career as a teacher, trainer, coach, educator and lived experience academic.
                  While filling a role in local government he was charged with and convicted of receiving
                  secret commissions and served time in prison. During and since Lukasâ€™ incarceration, he
                  developed a strong interest in the role that previously incarcerated people have in the
                  development of policy and procedure and the educational opportunities provided to currently
                  and previously incarcerated people. He is a strong advocate for the importance of Convict
                  Criminology and Lived experience to provide balance to research and discussion and to
                  represent the missing voice, those that have lived incarceration.
